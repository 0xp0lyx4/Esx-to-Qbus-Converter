# How it works?
1 - Open the Esx lua file and copy all the codes in it. <br>
2 - Paste the Lua code into the code variable in the app.js file.<br>
3 - Open terminal and write node app.js<br>
4 - Your qbus script is written into output.lua in the folder.

# IMPORTANT
Esx script cannot convert 100% but it can convert certain expressions. Once converted, manually look at the file again.
